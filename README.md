# Sensitive-Intruder-alarm
We designed this intruder alarm system to be simple and 
easy to use there is a trip wire that is connected to a 555 
timer which is also connected to a voltage source. When 
the wire trips or if someone steps on the wire the circuit 
gets open which generates interrupt signal to 555 timer, 
which then generates an analog signal a buzzer and a 
LED, this is a brief explanation of how this model works.
